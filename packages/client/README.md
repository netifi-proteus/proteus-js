# proteus-js-client

proteus-js-client allows Javascript apps to connect to a Proteus broker and access services. By providing a destination name and login credentials, the app becomes a new destination on the network, and can both send and receive messages using the RSocket protocol.

## Installation

```
yarn add proteus-js-client
```

For more information on how to set up the client, go to [docs.netifi.com](https://docs.netifi.com) and click the menu link "Proteus JS Client".
